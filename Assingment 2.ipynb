    "The exact syntax for representing Boolean values may vary depending on the programming language.\n",

    "1.) True : It can be represented as \"true\", \"1\", \"yes\" or \"on\" depending on the language. For eg :\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python : True\n",
    "    JavaScript : true\n",
    "    C++ : true\n",
    "    SQL : 1 or 'true'\n",

    "\n",
    "The three different types of Boolean operators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) AND Operator: The AND operator, typically represented as \"&&\" or \"AND,\" returns true if both operands\n",

    "2.) OR Operator: The OR operator, usually represented as \"||\" or \"OR,\" returns true if at least one of\n",
    "    the operands or conditions is true. It will only return false if both operands are false.\n",
    "    Here's an eg :\n",

    "    print(result)  # Output: True\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.) NOT Operator: The NOT operator, often represented as \"!\" or \"NOT,\" is a unary operator that negates\n",
    "    the value of the operand. If the operand is true, it returns false, and if the operand is false, it\n",
    "    returns true. Here's an eg :\n",
